1.  Create a text vector called `Months` with names of the 12 months of
    the year.

``` r
(Months <- c("January", "February", "March", "April", "May",
            "June", "July", "August", "September", "October",
            "November, December"))
```

     [1] "January"            "February"           "March"             
     [4] "April"              "May"                "June"              
     [7] "July"               "August"             "September"         
    [10] "October"            "November, December"

2.  Create a numeric vector `Summer`, with Calendar month index
    positions for the summer months (inclusive, with 4 elements in all).
    \[*Summer has only 3 months. —KJC*\]

``` r
(Summer <- 6:8)
```

    [1] 6 7 8

3.  Use vector indexing to extract the text values of `Months`, indexed
    by `Summer`.

``` r
Months[Summer]
```

    [1] "June"   "July"   "August"

4.  Multiply `Summer` by 3. What are the values of `Months`, when
    indexed by `Summer` multiplied by 3? Why do you get that answer?

``` r
Months[Summer * 3]
```

    [1] NA NA NA

You get `NA`s because the index exceeds the vector bounds.

5.  What is the mean (average) summer month, as an integer value? Which
    value of `Months` corresponds to it? Why do you get that answer?

``` r
mean(Summer)
```

    [1] 7

``` r
Months[mean(Summer)]
```

    [1] "July"

“July” is the seventh item of the `Months` vector.

6.  Use the `floor()` and `ceiling` functions to return the upper and
    lower limits of `Months` for the average `Summer` month.

``` r
Months[floor(mean(Summer))]
```

    [1] "July"

``` r
Months[ceiling(mean(Summer))]
```

    [1] "July"

7.  Using the `store.df` data from Sec. 2.5, how many visits did Bert’s
    store have?

``` r
store.df[store.df$store.manager == "Bert", ]$store.visits
```

    [1] 78

8.  It is easy to make mistakes in indexing. How can you confirm that
    the previous answer is actually from Bert’s store? Show this with a
    command that produces no more than one row of console output.

``` r
store.df[store.df$store.manager == "Bert", ]
```

      store.num store.rev store.visits store.manager
    2        14       654           78          Bert

9.  Write a function called `PieArea` that takes the length of a slice
    of pie and returns the area of a whole pie.

``` r
PieArea <- function(r) { return(pi * r^2) }
```

10. What is `PieArea` for slices with lengths 4.0, 4.5, 5.0, and 6.0?

``` r
PieArea(c(4.0, 4.5, 5.0, 6.0))
```

    [1]  50.26548  63.61725  78.53982 113.09734

11. Rewrite the previous command as one line of code, without using the
    `PieArea` function. Which of the two solutions do you prefer, and
    why?

``` r
pi * c(4.0, 4.5, 5.0, 6.0)^2
```

    [1]  50.26548  63.61725  78.53982 113.09734

I prefer the first solution, because the computation is clearer and it
is reusable.
